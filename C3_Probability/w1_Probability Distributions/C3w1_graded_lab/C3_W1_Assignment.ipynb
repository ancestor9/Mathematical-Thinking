Don't worry, you will be guided throughout the entire assignment!\n","\n","A random variable $X$ is a function that represents a random phenomenon, meaning its exact value cannot be determined. However, probabilities can be assigned to a set of possible values it can take. For example, if $X$ has a uniform distribution on $[2, 4]$, we cannot determine the exact value of $X$, but we can say with a probability of $1$ that the value lies between $[2, 4]$. We can also say that:\n","\n","$$P(X \\leq 3) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n","\n","where $3$ is the midpoint of the interval $[2, 4]$. Therefore, you have learned that a random variable is associated with a function called the probability density function (pdf), which encodes the probability of the random variable falling within a given range. In other words, if $X$ is a continuous random variable and $f$ is its pdf, then:\n","\n","$$P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\text{Area of } f \\text{ between } a \\text{ and } b$$\n","\n","In the discrete case, $P(X = a) = f(a)$. In any case, $P(-\\infty < X < +\\infty) = 1$ because a random variable is assumed to output real numbers.\n","\n","Another function associated with a random variable is the cumulative distribution function (cdf), denoted as $F$. It represents the probability that a random variable $X$ will be less than or equal to $x$, for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n","\n","$$F(x) := P(X \\leq x), \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\n","\n","The cdf is a non-decreasing function and approaches $1$ as $x$ approaches infinity because it represents a probability and must yield a value between $0$ and $1$.\n","\n","In the lectures, you learned that if $X$ is a random variable with cdf $F$, then $F(X)$ follows a uniform distribution between $0$ and $1$. In other words, the new random variable $F(X)$ will be uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$. This opens up the possibility of generating artificial data with any desired distribution, given that we know $F$. The process is as follows:\n","\n","1. Generate a random value $y$ uniformly from the interval $[0, 1]$.\n","2. Compute $F^{-1}(y)$, which is the inverse function of $F$ evaluated at $y$.\n","\n","It can be shown that if $Y$ follows a uniform distribution between $0$ and $1$, then the random variable $F^{-1}(Y)$ has the same distribution as $X$.\n","\n","Therefore, by computing the inverse of $F$, you can generate artificial data from any known distribution! This is an incredibly powerful technique, isn't it?\n","\n","So far in the course, you have encountered three common probability distributions:\n","- Uniform\n","- Binomial\n","- Gaussian\n","\n","In the first part of this assignment, you will code a random generator for each of the above distributions!\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"001b9b4a","metadata":{"id":"001b9b4a"},"source":["## Exercise 1: Uniform Generator\n","\n","The natural first step is to create a function capable of generating random data that comes from the uniform distribution.

equal to $x$. For example, $\\lfloor 2.9 \\rfloor = 2$ and $\\lfloor 1.2 \\rfloor = 1$. This function is necessary because the domain of $F$ is the entire set of real numbers, but $P(X = k)$ is non-zero only for positive integer values.\n","\n","If $x > n$, then $F(x) = 1$. It is important to note that the expression for $F(x)$ can become complex and messy, and there is no closed-form expression for the inverse function $F^{-1}$ in this case. However, statistical libraries provide implementations of the inverse CDF using [generalized quantile functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function#Inverse_distribution_function_.28quantile_function.29). You can refer to [scipy.stats.binom](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.binom.html) for an example of a library that implements these functions. In particular, the `scipy.stats.binom.ppf` function is what you need. Since the `binom` class is already imported, you can use `help(binom)` to explore its parameters and functions. The function you will need is located in the \"Methods\" section: `ppf`.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"id":"1819bfed","metadata":{"tags":["graded"],"id":"1819bfed","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770387170249,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"sanggoo

Also don't worry about the `__repr__` method, this only controls how many decimal points are printed out when you print an object of these dataclasses."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"c34979c7","metadata":{"tags":["graded"],"id":"c34979c7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770387186903,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":27,"user":{"displayName":"sanggoo cho","userId":"05013997244878666178"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["@dataclass\n","class params_gaussian:\n","    mu: float\n","    sigma: float\n","\n","    def __repr__(self):\n","        return f\"params_gaussian(mu={self.mu:.3f}, sigma={self.sigma:.3f})\"\n","\n","\n","@dataclass\n","class params_binomial:\n","    n: int\n","    p: float\n","\n","    def __repr__(self):\n","        return f\"params_binomial(n={self.n:.3f}, p={self.p:.3f})\"\n","\n","\n","@dataclass\n","class params_uniform:\n","    a: int\n","    b: int\n","\n","    def __repr__(self):\n","        return f\"params_uniform(a={self.a:.3f}, b={self.b:.3f})\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"546474bf","metadata":{"id":"546474bf"},"source":["Now that you have a place to store information about the parameters for different probability distributions you will define a dictionary that has the information for every breed of dogs:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"id":"4e9b5468","metadata":{"tags":["graded"],"id":"4e9b5468","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770387188600,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"sanggoo cho","userId":"05013997244878666178"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["breed_params = {\n","    0: {\n","        \"height\": params_gaussian(mu=35, sigma=1.5),\n","        \"weight\": params_gaussian(mu=20, sigma=1),\n","        \"bark_days\": params_binomial(n=30, p=0.8),\n","        \"ear_head_ratio\": params_uniform(a=0.6, b=0.1)\n","    },\n","\n","    1: {\n","        \"height\": params_gaussian(mu=30, sigma=2),\n","        \"weight\": params_gaussian(mu=25, sigma=5),\n","        \"bark_days\": params_binomial(n=30, p=0.5),\n","        \"ear_head_ratio\": params_uniform(a=0.2, b=0.5)\n","    },\n","\n","    2: {\n","        \"height\": params_gaussian(mu=40, sigma=3.5),\n","        \"weight\": params_gaussian(mu=32, sigma=3),\n","        \"bark_days\": params_binomial(n=30, p=0.3),\n","        \"ear_head_ratio\": params_uniform(a=0.1, b=0.3)\n","    }\n","\n","}"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"626fbe23","metadata":{"id":"626fbe23"},"source":["With the parameters and distributions for each breed defined you will generate the dataset.

So, $X = \\{ \\text{dog}_1, \\text{dog}_2, \\ldots, \\text{dog}_{100} \\}$, and each dog breed, for instance, dog 5, will be represented as a 3-dimensional vector: $\\text{dog}_5 = (\\text{ear head ratio}_{\\text{dog}_5}, \\text{weight}_{\\text{dog}_5}, \\text{height}_{\\text{dog}_5})$.\n","\n","Suppose that there are $m$ classes $C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_m$.

Naive Bayes does so by computing the posterior probabilities of a sample belonging to class $C_i$, i.e., it computes\n","\n","$$P(C_i \\mid x), \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, m.$$\n","\n","The predicted class is the $C_i$ with the highest probability. More formally, considering the set of every posterior probability of a given sample, what Naive Bayes computes is:\n","\n","$$\\text{predicted class for } x = \\arg \\max \\left\\{ P(C_1 \\mid x), P(C_2 \\mid x), \\ldots, P(C_m \\mid x) \\right\\}$$\n","\n","So, if the highest value is $P(C_4 \\mid x)$, then $\\arg \\max \\left\\{ P(C_1 \\mid x), P(C_2 \\mid x), \\ldots, P(C_m \\mid x) \\right\\} = 4$.\n","\n","To compute the posterior probability $P(C_i \\mid x)$, we use the Bayes' Theorem:\n","\n","$$P(C_i \\mid x) = \\frac{P(x \\mid C_i)P(C_i)}{P(x)}.$$\n","\n","Note that $P(x)$ is positive and constant for every class $C_i$, therefore, to maximize $P(C_i \\mid x)$, it is sufficient to maximize $P(x \\mid C_i)P(C_i)$. The probabilities $P(C_i)$ are called the class prior probabilities, and they denote how likely a random sample from $X$ (without knowing any of its attributes) is to belong to each class. This value is usually not known and can be estimated from the training set by computing the proportion of each class in the training set. If the training set is too small, it is common to assume that each class is equally likely, i.e., $P(C_1) = P(C_2) = \\ldots = P(C_m)$, thus only maximizing $P(x \\mid C_i)$ remains. We will work with the more general case here.\n","\n","In general, it would be computationally expensive to compute $P(x \\mid C_i)$ for each $x$ and each class, this is why a **naive** assumption of **class-conditional independence** is made. This assumption states that each attribute is independent of each other attribute within each class. It is a strong assumption. For example, in our dog breed example, it would mean that for a specific type of dog breed, there is no correlation between its weight, height, and ear head ratio.\n","\n","Assuming class-conditional independence, for an $x = (x_1, \\ldots x_n)$ in $X$:\n","\n","$$P(x \\mid C_i) = P(x_1 \\mid C_i) \\cdot P(x_2 \\mid C_i) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot P(x_n \\mid C_i) = \\prod_{k = 1}^{n} P(x_k \\mid C_i).$$\n","\n","The probabilities $P(x_k \\mid C_i)$ can be estimated from the training data. The computation of $P(x_k \\mid C_i)$ depends on whether $x_k$ is categorical or not.\n","\n","- If $x_k$ is categorical, then $P(x_k \\mid C_i)$ is the number of samples in $X$ that have attribute $x_k$ divided by the number of samples in class $C_i$.\n","\n","- If $x_k$ is continuous-valued or discrete-valued, we need to make an assumption about its distribution and estimate its parameters using the training data. For instance, if $x_k$ is continuous-valued, we can assume that $P(x_k \\mid C_i)$ follows a Gaussian distribution with parameters $\\mu_{C_i}$ and $\\sigma_{C_i}$. Therefore, we need to estimate $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ from the training data, and then $P(x_k \\mid C_i) = \\text{PDF}_{\\text{gaussian}}(x_k, \\mu_{C_i}, \\sigma_{C_i})$."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b86787fc","metadata":{"id":"b86787fc"},"source":["## Exercise 4: PDF for Distributions\n","\n","To calculate the probabilities of predicting each class using Naive Bayes, you need to compute the prior probabilities.
